The AI engineer has significantly expanded the Hybrid Human application, moving from core functionality to a sophisticated two-mode system (onboarding/unlocked) and extensive UI/UX enhancements. Initially, the engineer focused on implementing product selection for machine-related tickets in the mobile app's contact form, requiring backend updates for  and subsequent frontend UI/logic. This phase encountered persistent Metro bundler caching issues, necessitating various workarounds and troubleshooting.

Subsequently, a major architectural shift was introduced: a two-mode system for users (onboarding and unlocked). This involved adding new data models and API endpoints to the FastAPI backend for managing user lifecycle, lifestyle forms, shipment tracking, and DNA collection. The mobile app's Home and Schedule screens were adapted to this system, displaying dynamic content and locked features based on the user's mode. Concurrently, the admin panel was enhanced to manage users, their modes, and tracking statuses. UI/UX was a recurring focus, with a global color scheme update, safe area handling, accessibility fixes for text/placeholders, and a transition to hamburger menu navigation with animations for both mobile and admin panels. The final steps involved completing the admin panel UI for the hamburger menu.

<product_requirements>
The Hybrid Human app is a premium anti-aging platform for high-value customers owning specific devices. It features JWT authentication, 'Regular User' and 'Admin' roles. The mobile app initially required Home (history, quotes, upcoming schedule), Schedule (personalized tasks), Contact Us (program call scheduling, machine ticket raising with product selection), and Profile (user details, reports, test scheduling, logout, owned devices, usage logs, product description). The UI needed a minimal luxury feel with black, olive green, and bleach tones. A separate web-based Admin Panel was required for user management (create, assign products, default passwords), programs (create, assign, templates), reports (upload PDF), tickets, calls, and progress tracking (completion, streaks, task history, data export).

Further requirements introduced a two-mode system:
1.  **Onboarding Mode (mandatory 25-day period for first-time users):** Collects lifestyle data via a 4-step form (basic info, lifestyle, nutrition, medical). Users track product shipment and DNA collection status. Schedules and Reports are locked. Home displays tracking cards. Support allows video uploads (max 100MB, .mp4, mock S3). Profile is editable, but reports are empty. Admin controls this flow, updating statuses and unlocking users.
2.  **Unlocked Mode (Post-Onboarding):** Admin manually switches users. Home shows program summary/device performance. Schedule is activated with tasks. Profile shows uploaded DNA/health reports. Existing users default to Unlocked.

New features also include:
*   A dedicated Product Range section in the mobile app with a catalog of machine cards, each linking to a detailed product description page.
*   Hamburger icon navigation with smooth collapse/expand and slide transitions for both mobile and admin applications, replacing bottom tab navigation on mobile.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was implementing the second part of the UI/UX enhancement related to navigation. Specifically, the admin panel's  and  files were being updated to transition from the previous navigation system to a hamburger menu with smooth collapse/expand and slide animations, leveraging Shadcn UI patterns. The  component was updated to render the new navigation structure, and  received the necessary styling for the animations and hamburger icon. The last action was updating  to support the new animations for the admin panel. The previous chat message confirmed Perfect! Now let me create a comprehensive final summary:, indicating the UI work for the admin panel navigation was considered complete by the AI engineer.
